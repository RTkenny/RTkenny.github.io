Welcome to my personal website! I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Guanghua School of Management, Peking University, with a research focus on BP-free training paradigms, reinforcement learning, and optimization. My work explores novel learning frameworks that move beyond backpropagation, aiming for more efficient and scalable AI training methods.

I hold dual bachelorâ€™s degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Artificial Intelligence from Harbin Institute of Technology. With a strong engineering background, I am passionate about combining theoretical analysis with practical engineering to develop new learning paradigms and optimize AI-driven decision-making for real-world applications.
