Welcome to my personal website! I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the [Guanghua School of Management, Peking University](www.https://www.gsm.pku.edu.cn/). My superviser is Professer Yijie Peng. I focus on BP-free training paradigms, reinforcement learning, and optimization. My work explores novel learning frameworks that move beyond backpropagation, aiming for more efficient and scalable AI training methods. I also have great interest in quantitivate finance.

I hold dual bachelorâ€™s degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Artificial Intelligence from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2023. With a strong engineering background, I am passionate about combining theoretical analysis with practical engineering to develop new learning paradigms and optimize AI-driven decision-making for real-world applications.
